2185. Counting Words With a Given Prefix (Easy)

// Question
You are given an array of strings words and a string pref.
Return the number of strings in words that contain pref as a prefix.
A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["pay","attention","practice","attend"], pref = "at"
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "attention" and "attend".
Example 2:

Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
 

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 100
1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100
words[i] and pref consist of lowercase English letters.

//Solution
class Solution {
public:
    int prefixCount(vector<string>& words, string pref) {
        int count = 0;
        for(auto i: words){
            int a=0,b=0;
            while(a<i.size() && b<pref.size()){
                if(i[a]!=pref[b]) break;
                a++;b++;
                if(a==pref.size()) count++;
            }
        } 
        return count;
    }
};
